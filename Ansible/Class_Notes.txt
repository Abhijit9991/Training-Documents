		IAC Tool 
		
		IAC - Infra-Structure As Code !!!
		
		Traditional way of Infra-Structure Management 
		
		Linux/Window --> 
		
		Shell Scripts 
		CLI 
		APIs 
		
		
		IAC --> Tool --> Declarative Languages - *.yaml/*.json/HCL
		
		Provisioning/Creating the Servers		==> Terraform 
		
		Configuration of Servers 				==> Configuration Management Tool - Ansible 
			- Install/Unsstall/Upgrade 
		
		Jenkins_Master 
			Jenkins_Slave1,....,10
			
		
		Ansible Architecture :::
			Ansible Controller & Ansible Clients
			It uses the Push Mechanism.
				Module/function will be pushed into the target server 
			It is Agentless.
			
			All the Nodes should have python installed.
			
		Components of Ansible Architecture :::
		
			- Ansible Controller 
			- Ansible Target Nodes 
			- Inventory 			# used to maintain the Details of the target Nodes 
			- Modules 				# Is the actual Script we execute in the target nodes.
			- ansible config file	# Used to maintain the default properties of Ansible.
		
		Terminologies :
			- Push Mechanism 
			- Inventory 			# used to maintain the Details of the target Nodes 
			- Modules 				# Is the actual Script we execute in the target nodes.			
		
		Working with Ansible :
		
			- Ansible Adhoc Commands 	# Used to run a task/Module on adhoc basis
			
			- Ansible Playbook			# Script written using *.yaml 
										Defines the Tasks/Modules to be executed in target Nodes
										
			- Using Jenkins, the playbooks can scheduled to run in the target. 
									  
			- Ansible Roles 			# Are used to Organize the Ansible Components 
										# Reuse/Share.
										# Github Repositories are used to maintain/Organize the Ansible Components
